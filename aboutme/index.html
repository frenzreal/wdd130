        <p>Hi everyone! Let me introduce myself. I am Florence Real. I live in Quezon City, Philippines. My timezone is PhST (GMT+8). I am single, and I'm still searching for my eternal companion. I served as a full-time missionary in the Philippines Baguio Mission. I was baptized on my 8th birthday. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 22 years. My hobbies include drawing (traditional and digital), playing musical instruments, and reading books.</p>
        <p>I am pursuing BS Applied Technology at BYU-Idaho. Aside from being a student, I also have a full-time job. I am currently working as a web developer at a CRO (conversion rate optimization) company. I've been working there for 3 years now, but I know I still have a lot to learn. Although I have this job, I don't have a degree related to computers.</p>
        <p>I earned my bachelors degree in mechanical engineer here in the Philippines. Months after my graduation, I felt that I want to change my career and pursue my best interest, and that is creating websites.</p>
        <p>I started to learn CSS and HTML when I was young. I learned through myspace. I got interested in changing backgrounds, colors, and even adding music to the background. I enjoy what I'm doing at work and I'm always excited to learn new things. And that's one good thing about this field. Technology always advances, and thus, I have a lot of things to learn.</p>
