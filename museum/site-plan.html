        The Gallery is an informative website that is open to all people who wanted to know more about the cultural history of the Philippines through museums. The website provides answers to the viewers' questions about the basic things to know about the different museums located in the Philippines. The basic questions may include location, museum theme, timeslots, and basic history of the museum. 
        Other questions not mentioned here in this website will be entertained. Website visitors may send us an email with their questions. The Gallery website will provide a form asking for the email address and the message they wanted to convey, names are optional. Questions are not the only email The Gallery website will entertain, but the website also accepts suggestions, clarifications and other things the website viewers wanted to share. Also, the website viewers may also book a tour through us by sending a message through email for any reservation.
        The unique thing about this website is that The Gallery website is not just an ordinary blog. It contains collective information that will benefit the website viewers. So, instead of visiting several blogs or websites of the museums, The Gallery summarizes the critical information that a tourist needs to know before visiting the museum. I believe that this feature will help website visitors to make their research faster and efficient.

      <h3>Museums</h3>
      <p>
        This page of The Gallery website addresses the critical information that a tourist needs to know. The first thing is the image. This page will show a large image that will show exterior of the museum. This is beneficial because first time tourists and visitors will be able to recognize the museum once they have visited the location. One of the problems when visiting a museum is sometimes, people can get lost and they will to spend a lot of time finding the museum. Thus, this image gives a sense of familiarity to those who have viewed the website before visiting the vicinity of the museum.
        Another thing on this page is the brief summary or history of the museums listed on this page. It gives a wonderful background story so that the website visitors will have a better connection to the museum, thus having a wonderful experience once they have gone to the location.
        Oftentimes, some people visit the museum but it turns out that the museum is not open. Therefore, timeslot is an important information that a tourist needs to know before visiting. This page of the website will indicate the operating hours and schedule of the museum. In addition to this, upcoming holidays are listed beside the timeslot so that website viewers will be well informed.

      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <p>
        This page of The Gallery website is a very important one. It includes the questions that are frequently asked by the people who visits the museum. The frequently asked questions include, but not limited to, dress code, camera restrictions, food and beverage access, and tourist guide availability. I believe these frequently asked questions are important because they give immediate answers to the website viewers so that the website viewers can save time and energy looking for answers that are just readily available.
        This page of The Gallery website also includes a form wherein website viewers can contact me by filling out the form which asks for their email address and concern. The email address is important because I will reply through their email. This part is beneficial because if a website viewer happens to have a question that is not listed in the frequently asked questions, then the website viewer can send their queries through the form and expect a reply as soon as possible.
